# eau de parfum

### ABOUT
"eau de parfum" was a game made for the Finally Finish Something game jam of 2020. This is a strategic game about rolling dice and making perfumes made across a month.

The game was made in PICO-8 using the language of Lua. If one has the PICO-8 console you can simply download the eaudeparfum.p8 file and load it straight into the program (you can also look at the source code if you press ESC whilst in the console). Otherwise you can open the .p8 file with any text editor and see the code. You can play the game at https://arkicade.itch.io/eau-de-parfum.
